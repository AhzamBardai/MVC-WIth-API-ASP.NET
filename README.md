This project has currently not been started to view my latest ASP.NET project, please visit [this project](https://github.com/AhzamBardai/Dotnet-Security) instead. Thank for your time and patience. I look forward to hearing your response!

# MVC-WIth-API-ASP.NET
First project with both MVC and API in one ASP.NET Core codebase. Plan is to make a Inventory/POS app with multiple models and controllers. This will have a fully functioning MVC UI and will be connected to a Frontend later on.
